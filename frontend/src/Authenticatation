There are number of auth method, which includes 
1) JWT
2) OAuth
3) 

1. Factor-based Authentication:
- Single-Factor Authentication: Requires only one type of authentication factor (e.g., password-only authentication).
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Requires two or more different types of authentication factors (e.g., password + fingerprint, or password + SMS code).
2. Authentication Factors:
- Something You Know: Knowledge-based factors like passwords, PINs, or security questions.
- Something You Have: Possession-based factors like physical tokens, smart cards, or mobile devices.
- Something You Are: Biometric factors like fingerprints, retina scans, facial recognition, or voice recognition.

3. Authentication Methods:
- Password-based Authentication: Relies on a user's knowledge of a secret password.
- Biometric Authentication: Uses unique physical or behavioral characteristics for identification.
- Token-based Authentication: Relies on physical or digital tokens to generate authentication codes.
- Certificate-based Authentication: Uses digital certificates to verify the authenticity of a user or device.
- Social Media Authentication: Allows users to log in using their social media credentials.
- Knowledge-based Authentication: Involves answering security questions or providing specific personal information.
4. Context-based Authentication:
- Static Context Authentication: Considers fixed attributes such as IP address or device type.
- Dynamic Context Authentication: Considers real-time attributes like geolocation, time of access, or user behavior.
5. Security Level:
- Low Assurance Authentication: Basic authentication methods with limited security measures.
- Medium Assurance Authentication: Incorporates additional security factors but may not be foolproof.
- High Assurance Authentication: Utilizes highly secure methods like strong cryptographic techniques or multiple advanced factors.

6. User Experience:
- Convenient Authentication: Focuses on ease of use, allowing users to log in quickly.
- Secure Authentication: Prioritizes security, even if it means slightly inconveniencing the user with additional steps.

7. Implementation:
- Centralized Authentication: Authentication is managed centrally, providing a single point of authentication for multiple applications.
- Decentralized Authentication: Each application or service manages its own authentication process independently.
